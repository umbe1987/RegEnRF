`rerf` is the implementation of the Regression-Enhanced Random Forests algorithm as described in [Zhang et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1904.10416).

## Installation

You can install the development version of rerf like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("umbe1987/rerf")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to perform Regression-Enhanced Random Forests regression with `rerf`:

```{r example}
library(rerf)
x <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 20), 100, 20)
y <- rnorm(100)
mod <- rerf(x, y, 0.1)
predict(mod, newx = x)
```
